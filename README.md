# 2nd CodeClan Project.
## JavaScript group project (4 persons).

## Summary
Planetary data from external APIs is consumed using React on the front-end and Express/MongoDB on the back-end.   This project made use of React Hooks, Styled Components and custom CSS including animations.  External data was used to generate quizzes, fun facts to visualise data.   An internal API connected the front-end to the back-end to persist users quiz results and favorite planets.  Data visualisation was achieved using charting libraries.

Experience was gained working as part of a cohesive and energetic team working remotely using Trello,  GitHub and VSCode Live Share.   The team worked using AGILE principles.  The instructors acted as product owners and we held daily stand-ups to allocate work and assess progress.

## The Brief (CodeClan)

<blockquote>
# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- view some educational content on a particular topic
- be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

## Example Extensions

- Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
- Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.

## API, Libraries, Resources

- https://www.highcharts.com/ HighCharts is an open-source library for rendering responsive charts.
- https://leafletjs.com/ Leaflet is an open-source library for rendering maps and map functionality.
